# PainlessProxy API Gateway Documentation

Welcome to PainlessProxy! ðŸš€ Your gateway to effortless microservices management. Our core concept is simplicity, making it a breeze to connect and handle microservices, even those with callbacks. ðŸ˜Œ Forget about the complexities of managing callbacks in the gateway; PainlessProxy automatically routes them to the right microservice, giving you a painless experience. ðŸŽ¯

This approach may seem simple, but it has the potential to solve a multitude of problems, especially for its creator. ðŸ§™ Join us in simplifying microservices management with PainlessProxy! ðŸŒŸ


## Basic Idea

The core concept behind our API Gateway is to streamline the process of connecting and managing microservices. Here are the fundamental components of this concept:

### Microservice Key Generation

- Each microservice will generate a unique key, which can be based on the application name or another identifier of your choice.
- We store the ID of the microservice in a database, with Redis being an option for faster data retrieval.

### Route Creation

- We create routes that accept a parameterized key, allowing for dynamic routing based on the provided key.
- Requests are directed to the appropriate microservice based on the provided key.

### Callback Handling

- When a callback request is received, it includes the service ID as part of the URL.
- The API Gateway performs the following logic for callback handling:

#### Callback ID Verification

- It checks the callback ID from the URL to ensure it is valid.

#### Logging

- Callback data and the IP address are logged in a .log file for auditing and debugging purposes.

#### Database Query

- The API Gateway queries the database to retrieve the relevant microservice information associated with the callback ID.

#### HTTP Call to Payment Service

- It makes an HTTP call to the payment service, forwarding the callback data as needed.

#### Response

- The callback endpoint always returns a JSON response: `{"thank":"you"}`.

## API Endpoint

The API Gateway's callback endpoint is structured as follows:
