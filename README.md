# PainlessProxy API Gateway Documentation

Welcome to PainlessProxy! ðŸš€ Your gateway to effortless microservices management. Our core concept is simplicity, making it a breeze to connect and handle microservices, even those with callbacks. ðŸ˜Œ Forget about the complexities of managing callbacks in the gateway; PainlessProxy automatically routes them to the right microservice, giving you a painless experience. ðŸŽ¯

This approach may seem simple, but it has the potential to solve a multitude of problems, especially for its creator. ðŸ§™ Join us in simplifying microservices management with PainlessProxy! ðŸŒŸ


## Basic Idea

The core concept behind our API Gateway is to streamline the process of connecting and managing microservices. Here are the fundamental components of this concept:

### Microservice Key Generation

- we will have some sort of registry that stores the data for each microservice, i.e port and base-path

#### Callback Handling

- When a callback request is received, it includes the service ID as part of the URL.
    `http://api.gatewat.com/gateway/callback/<str:serviceID>`
- The API Gateway performs the following logic for callback handling:

##### Callback ID Verification
- It checks the callback ID from the URL to ensure it is valid.

#### Logging

- Callback data and the IP address are logged in a .log file for auditing and debugging purposes.

#### Database Query

- The API Gateway queries the database to retrieve the relevant microservice information associated with the callback ID.

#### HTTP Call to Payment Service

- It makes an HTTP call to the payment service, forwarding the callback data as needed.

#### Response

- The callback endpoint always returns a JSON response: `{"thank":"you"}`.

## API Endpoint

The API Gateway's callback endpoint is structured as follows:
