# PainlessProxy API Gateway Documentation

Welcome to PainlessProxy! ðŸš€ Your gateway to effortless microservices management. Our core concept is simplicity, making it a breeze to connect and handle microservices, even those with callbacks. Forget about the complexities of managing callbacks in the gateway; PainlessProxy automatically routes them to the right microservice, giving you a painless experience. ðŸŽ¯

This approach may seem simple, but it has the potential to solve a multitude of problems.  Join us in simplifying microservices management with PainlessProxy! ðŸŒŸ


## Basic Idea

The core concept behind our API Gateway is to streamline the process of connecting and managing microservices. Here are the fundamental components of this concept:

### Microservice Key Generation

- we will have some sort of registry that stores the data for each microservice, i.e port and base-path

#### Callback Handling

- When a callback request is received, it includes the service ID as part of the URL.
    `http://api.gatewat.com/gateway/callback/<str:serviceID>`

#### Response

- The callback endpoint always returns a JSON response: `{"response":"OK"}`.
